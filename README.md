1.
# Sorting Algorithms
This C++ program demonstrates three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
It sorts an array of integers in ascending order and prints the sorted array.

2. 
# Merge Sort Recursive
This C++ program demonstrates the Merge Sort algorithm using recursion.
It sorts a vector of integers in ascending order and prints the sorted vector.

3.
# Merge Sort Iterative
This C++ program demonstrates the Merge Sort algorithm using an iterative approach (bottom-up merge sort).
It sorts a vector of integers in ascending order and prints the sorted vector.
